Since its inception, it has expanded to include about 5,824 geotracked bicycles, which can be locked into any of the 692 stations spread throughout Chicago. Riders can unlock a bike from one station and return it to any other station.\n\n## Business Task \nDiscover how members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently and design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members.\n\n## Data Sources \nThe data used in this analysis were sourced from Kaggle's Cyclistic dataset, covering the period from June 2023 to May 2024.

Findings","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The analysis reveals several key differences between casual riders and members:\n\nRider Distribution:\n\n* The data shows a significant difference between the number of casual riders and members, with members outnumbering casual riders by 1,643,974 riders (Figure 1).\n\nSeasonal Riding Patterns:\n\n* Both casual riders and members exhibit increased activity during spring and summer. However, casual riders peak in July, while members peak in August. Both groups see a decline in ride counts during the fall and winter months (Figure 3).\n\nRide Duration:\n\n* Casual riders tend to have longer ride durations compared to members. The average ride time for casual riders is 28.20 minutes, whereas members average 12.92 minutes. Throughout the week, casual riders generally have rides exceeding 20 minutes, while members average below 13 minutes (Figures 4.1 and 4.2).\n\nWeekly Ride Activity:\n\n* There are distinct patterns in ride activity between the two groups. Members’ ride counts are highest on weekdays, peaking on Thursday and tapering off over the weekend. Conversely, casual riders are more active on weekends, with their counts peaking on Saturday (Figure 5).\n\nPopular Start and End Stations:\n\n* For casual riders, the most frequented starting point to casual rider's ride is Streeter Dr & Grand Ave, followed by Dusable Lake Shore Dr & Monroe St, Millennium Park, Theater on the Lake, and Michigan Ave & Oak St. (Figures 6.1). As for end stations, Streeter Dr & Grand Ave emerges as the most popular end station, followed by Dusable Lake Shore Dr & Monroe St, Dusable Lake Shore Dr & North Blvd, Michigan Ave & Oak St, and Theater on the Lake (Figures 7.1).\n\n* Members, on the other hand, prefer starting station Clark St & Elm St followed by Clinton St & Washington Blvd, Wabash Ave & Grand Ave, Canal St & Adams St, and Dearborn St & Monroe St (Figures 6.2). For ending stations, Kingsbury St & Kinzie St is the most popular followed by Wilton Ave & Belmont Ave, Canal St & Adams St, LaSalle St & Illinois St, and Dearborn Pkwy & Delaware Pl (Figures 7.2).","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Recommendations \nTo address the question of how to convert casual riders into annual members, I have made three recommendations. Firstly, I suggest setting up membership ads during the months when casual rider are most active, specifically June, July, and August. Since casual riders are particularly active during these months, this strategy will attract a lot of attention from casual members and encourage them to sign up. Secondly, implementing membership advertisements at the top 3 most popular starting stations (Streeter Dr & Grand Ave, Dusable Lake Shore Dr & Monroe St, Millennium Park) and top 3 most popular ending stations (Streeter Dr & Grand Ave, Dusable Lake Shore Dr & Monroe St, Dusable Lake Shore Dr & North Blvd) could effectively encourage more casual riders to become members.. Lastly, on average, casual riders ride for 28 minutes per trip. Highlighting the cost savings of a membership compared to day passes for longer rides could further incentivize casual riders to sign up for memberships.","metadata":{}}]}

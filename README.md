# bikesharing_data_analysis
This data analysis project aims to clean and analyze data to highlight how casual riders differ from annual members and provide recommendations for converting casual riders into annual members. The data is sourced from a bike-sharing company in Chicago, covering the period from June 2023 to May 2024.

The "tripdata_analysis.py" file is a script that cleans, manipulates, and analyzes the bike-sharing data. Libraries used: pandas, matplotlib, and numpy

I am unable to add the trip data folder that contains all Excel files from the bike-sharing company due to file size limitations on Github. However, you can access the data through the following link: https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html

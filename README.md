Conducted an in-depth analysis of Cyclistic bike-share 12 month data to uncover behavioral patterns and usage differences between members and casual riders. Used Python libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib) for exploration, data cleaning, data manipulation, feature engineering, visualization. Used a Machine learning model (KNeighborsClassifier) to handle missing values during data cleaning. Provided actionable recommendations to convert casual riders into annual members based on the findings.
